# Web-Technologies Module
## Repository for assessment work for my Web Technologies module

Each relevant unit (where the work is a html/css output) has a folder in this repository holding the assessments.

**The uploaded PDF file contains:**
1. Descriptions and evidence of all the weekly coursework, including links to work on WordPress (for units 3, 7, and 10).
2. Bibliography of images included in the work.
